# contains configuration of the detector during this run.
# keyword    value0    value1    value2    ...
# active_stations   list all active stations with 2 tabs in between them.
# complete list: lasa1 , lasa2, lasa3, lasa4, lasa5
# lofar_trig_mode : 1: LORA stations 2: LORA detectors - > FOR LOFAR. Not LORA trigger.
# lofar_trig_condition : Min no. of LORA Stations/Detectors required to send trigger to LOFAR
# lora_trig_mode : 1: LORA stations 2: LORA detectors - > FOR LORA.
# lora trig condition : Minimum no. of detectors / station.
# calibration_mode: 0 for none / 1 for electronics calibration mode / 2 for det calib mode.
# log_interval: in ms. period for storing log tree. i.e. threshold, mean_baseline, mean_sigma
# check_coinc_interval: in ms. previously event_spy_time. time period to check for coincidence in events stored in the buffer.
# coin_window : Coincidence time window in nanosecs for hits to belong to same event
# reset_thresh_interval : store noise data and reset threshold every 20 mins. in ms.
# wvfm_process_wpre : n bins before peak to include in window (total trace is 4000)
# wvfm_process_wpost :  n bins after peak to include in window (total trace is 4000)
# wvfm_process_offtwlen : n bins off window to include for baseline. (total trace is 4000)
# diagnostics_interval: interval for printing out to diagnostics file 30000 ms i.e. 30 s for now.
# sigma_ovr_thresh: for new threshold every hour. default value 5 for now.
# init_reset_thresh_interval: the first time has to be within 2 mins of daq start.
# output_save_hour: hour of the day when current o/p files are closed and new ones opened.
# tbb_dump_wait_min: min interval between two consecutive radio triggers.
